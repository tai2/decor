      Markdown[9] is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text
      using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as a
      markup language that is easy to read in its source code form.[9] Markdown
      is widely used for blogging and instant messaging, and also used elsewhere
      in online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme
      files.

    <p>
      The initial description of Markdown[10] contained ambiguities and raised
      unanswered questions, causing implementations to both intentionally and
      accidentally diverge from the original version. This was addressed in 2014
      when long-standing Markdown contributors released CommonMark, an
      unambiguous specification and test suite for Markdown.[11]

    <h3 data-decor-element="heading3">A Third Level Header</h3>
    <p>
      Markdown was inspired by pre-existing conventions for marking up plain
      text in email and usenet posts, such as the earlier markup languages
      setext (c. 1992), Textile (c. 2002), and reStructuredText (c. 2002).[

      In 2002 Aaron Swartz created atx and referred to it as "the true
      structured text format". Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004,
      with Swartz acting as beta tester,[3][4] with the goal of enabling people
      "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format,
      optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)."[5]
    </p>
    <h5 data-decor-element="heading5">A Fifth Level Header</h5>
    <p>
      Its key design goal was readability, that the language be readable as-is,
      without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting
      instructions,[9] unlike text formatted with 'heavier' markup languages,
      such as Rich Text Format (RTF), HTML, or even wikitext (each of which have
      obvious in-line tags and formatting instructions which can make the text
      more difficult for humans to read).
    </p>
    <h6 data-decor-element="heading6">A Sixth Level Header</h6>
    <p>
      Gruber wrote a Perl script, Markdown.pl, which converts marked-up text
      input to valid, well-formed XHTML or HTML and replaces angle brackets (<,
      >) and ampersands (&) with their corresponding character entity
      references. It can take the role of a standalone script, a plugin for
      Blosxom or a Movable Type, or of a text filter for BBEdit.[5]

    <h2>Paragraph</h2>
    <p data-decor-element="paragraph">
      Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
      bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
      book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
      it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or
      conversations?”
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot
      day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making
      a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
      daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
